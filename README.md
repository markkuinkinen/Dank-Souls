Created alongside Karin Domagalska, this project is our first look into creating a game with Unreal Engine 5. 

It was made to complete the "Portfolio project - 15 ECTS" course at Metropolia University of applied sciences. 

Although the gameplay can feel a little clunky at times, we had fun using Unreal to create it and we're proud of what was achieved. A lot about the engine was learnt in the process of its creation, especially regarding blueprints.

Everything except the assets, animations, and sounds were created and designed by us. No plugins or gameplay templates were used.
